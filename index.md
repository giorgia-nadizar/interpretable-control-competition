# Motivation
Control systems play a vital role in managing and regulating various processes and devices across diverse application domains. 
Their pervasive nature makes them a cornerstone of modern technology. 
Safety-critical applications, in particular, demand control systems that are not only efficient but also interpretable, ensuring trustworthiness, reliability, and accountability.
However, a prevalent issue in the field is the over-reliance on opaque systems, such as deep neural networks, known for their efficiency and optimization potential. 
This preference is rooted in the prevailing belief that interpretability is of secondary importance, with performance taking precedence. 
Furthermore, the scarcity of objective metrics to assess the degree of interpretability in a system exacerbates this problem. 
In fact, though the Evolutionary Computation (EC) community is starting to promote explainable and/or interpretable AI, significant challenges still persist in achieving comprehensive solutions.
The goal of this competition is thus to ignite the research domain of interpretable control, with two specific goals in mind. 
First, we want to create a basis of comparison for different techniques emphasizing the trade-offs between performance and interpretability. 
Second, through the involvement of a panel of human evaluators, we strive to uncover the key characteristics that enhance the interpretability of control policies, making them more accessible to the general user.

# Tasks
Building on previous editions, which explored both continuous and discrete control settings (from robotic locomotion to game-based environments), this year’s competition will take a step toward more realistic, safety-relevant scenarios. In collaboration with Airbus, a global leader in aerospace innovation and manufacturing, we will focus on a challenge related to aeronautical decision-making, focusing on relevant concrete scenarios that exemplify the complexity and reliability demands of real-world systems.

Participants will be welcome to enter the competition using their preferred methods to develop and interpret control policies for addressing the proposed task. We particularly encourage the incorporation of evolutionary computation techniques to enhance either policy generation or interpretability.

Submissions will be evaluated based on both performance and interpretability. Performance will be assessed through simulations of each submitted policy, while interpretability will be evaluated by a panel of judges, including domain experts from the industry.

# Submission deadline
1st June 2026 AoE.

# Results and dissemination
Our objective is to raise awareness regarding the importance of interpretability within the realm of control systems. 
To achieve this, we aim at collecting a wide variety of methodologies and publishing the results in a comprehensive report. 
We also plan to extend an invitation to select participants to become co-authors of this publication.

# Prize
The winner(s) will be awarded a certificate.
